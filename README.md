# Sudoku
My sudoku game!

Created on Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.0.0.dev6.
Requires both Python and Pygame to run.

Run the 'Sudoku' directory with Python3 to play the game.

"$ Python3 Sudoku"


A few things to potentially add for the future:
- allow storing of guesses
- allow multiple difficulties
- change location of backtracking recursion to show solving to user in real time
